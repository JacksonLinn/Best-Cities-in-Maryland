# Cities in Maryland

> Helping people find the best places to live in Maryland based on housing prices, job opportunities, and safety.

## Overview

Finding the perfect place to live in Maryland can be challenging. Our project simplifies this process by analyzing key factors such as housing costs, employment prospects, and community safety. Using data-driven insights, we provide a clearer view of different cities and neighborhoods across Maryland to help people make more informed decisions about where to settle.
